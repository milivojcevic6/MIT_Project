			<p class="textAlign"> Welcome to Karly's Stars. If it is your first time on the site,
			here are some tips for you. </p>
			<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
				<li class="list-group-item">You can find all of the important links in the navbar. </li>
				<li class="list-group-item">If you want the owner to connect the rating with your name, please first register.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">If you are already registered, you can log in from now on with the username and password from the registration.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">If you want to leave a rating or comment anonymously, you don't need to register.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">You can get to the list of the restaurants by clicking on 'Restaurants' from the navbar
				or 'Get started' on the home page.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">On the page 'Restaurants', you can create a restaurant if you are the owner.
				Otherwise, click 'Rate' to start with the rating.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">On the rating page, if you are the owner of that restaurant, you can add staff members or remove them. You can also rate them.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">On the rating page, if you are a staff member, you should be able to see the average ratings. If not, you cat just rate.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIPmpi-msXE&t=60s"> link </a> of the demo video that might help you.
